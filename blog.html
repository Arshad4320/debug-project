                <h4>what is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h4>
                <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s
                    local storage
                    object, the stored data
                    is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets
                    cleared when the page
                    session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a
                    browser is closed
                    (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).</p>
                <p><strong>Session Storage:</strong> Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage
                    read-only property.
                    The difference between
                    sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage
                    data is cleared when
                    the page session ends.</p>

                <h4>What is the difference between local scope and global scope?</h4>
                <p>Global scope — Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code
                    block simply consists
                    of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of
                    structure that create a
                    code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the
                    code.</p>
                <p>Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local
                    scope. A local variable
                    is only accessible where it’s declared.</p>

                <h4>How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?</h4>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the
                    Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
                    effectively runs it. Such
                    an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <h4>How many declaration javascript undefined?</h4>
                <p>Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value
                    when no value is
                    assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.
                    undefined is a token.examples undefined value:</p>
